    content: |-
      I am a Developer Relations and Community professional based in the Midwest. Currently the Head of DevRel & Community at CircleCI, I was previously at Solace, Auth0, XDA, and numerous consulting gigs. 
      With over 27 years in Tech, covering just about every functional area including Support, SysAdmin, Application Developer, Program Manager, and Business Analyst, I am active in the DevRel and DevOps communities, and co-created <a href="https://devopspartygames.com" target="_blank">DevOpsPartyGames.com</a>. 
      I am also house-broken, and (generally) play well with others.
      <p>I am passionate about community and software development, and the processes involved with each, and take great happiness in evolving the understanding between companies and their technical audience. I am driven to enable the technically savvy to be your greatest champions.</p>
