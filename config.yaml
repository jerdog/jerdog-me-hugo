    content: |-
      I am a seasoned Developer Experience and Community leader based in the Midwest, formerly the Director of DevRel & Community at CircleCI, and previously at Solace, Auth0, and XDA. 
      With almost 30 years in Tech, covering just about every functional area including support, system and database administration, application and web development, project management, program management, and systems analysis, I am active in the DevRel and DevOps communities, and co-created <a href="https://devopspartygames.com" target="_blank">DevOpsPartyGames.com</a>. Husband and father, I am house-broken, and (generally) play well with others.
      <p>I am passionate about community and software development, and the processes involved with each, and take great happiness in evolving the understanding between companies and their technical audience. I am driven to enable the technically savvy to be your greatest champions.</p>
