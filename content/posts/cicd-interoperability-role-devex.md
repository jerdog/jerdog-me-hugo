description: "CI/CD Standardization aims to minimize variability, reduce errors, and foster an environment where developers can efficiently collaborate. You can achieve standardization by defining explicit, repeatable code integration, testing, and deployment processes, thus ensuring a smooth development journey. Implementing CI/CD pipeline standardization is crucial for streamlining the development process and enhancing DevEx."
